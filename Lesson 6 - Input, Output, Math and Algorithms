# Step 1: Ask the user for their year of birth
year_of_birth = int(input("Enter your year of birth: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user for their age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Step 3: Double the birth year, then add 5
step1_result = (year_of_birth * 2) + 5

# Step 4: Multiply the result of the last step by 50, then add their age
step2_result = (step1_result * 50) + age

# Step 5: Subtract 250 from the result of the last calculation, then divide by 100
final_result = (step2_result - 250) / 100

# Step 6: Print the result and interpret it for the user
